# Execute estimation workflow for surveys

This function executes a sequence of statistical estimations on Survey
objects, applying functions from the R survey package with appropriate
metadata. Automatically handles different survey types and
periodicities.

## Usage

``` r
workflow(svy, ..., estimation_type = "monthly", level = 0.95)
```

## Arguments

- svy:

  A Survey object, a **list** of Survey objects, a PoolSurvey, or a
  RotativePanelSurvey. A single Survey is automatically wrapped in
  [`list()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html). Must contain properly
  configured sample design.

- ...:

  Calls to survey package functions (such as `svymean`, `svytotal`,
  `svyratio`, etc.) that will be executed sequentially

- estimation_type:

  Type of estimation (default `"monthly"`) that determines which weight
  to use. Options: `"monthly"`, `"quarterly"`, `"annual"`, or vector
  with multiple types. For PoolSurvey and RotativePanelSurvey objects,
  compound types such as `"annual:monthly"` or `"annual:mean_of_months"`
  aggregate monthly estimates into an annual one (see Details)

- level:

  Confidence level for the interval (default `0.95`). Passed to
  [`confint`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/confint.html). Can also be set
  per-call inside the estimation function (e.g.,
  `svymean(~x, na.rm = TRUE, level = 0.90)`), which overrides the
  `workflow()` default for that estimation.

## Value

`data.table` with results from all estimations, including columns:

- `stat`: Estimation call and variable name

- `variable`: Variable name (for filtering)

- `value`: Point estimate

- `se`: Standard error

- `cv`: Coefficient of variation (proportion)

- `confint_lower`: Lower bound of confidence interval

- `confint_upper`: Upper bound of confidence interval

- `evaluate`: CV quality label from
  [`evaluate_cv`](https://metasurveyr.github.io/metasurvey.core/reference/evaluate_cv.md)
  (e.g. "Excellent", "Good", "Use with caution")

For `svyby` estimations, grouping variables (e.g. `region`, `sexo`)
appear as additional columns.

## Details

The function automatically selects the appropriate sample design
according to the specified `estimation_type`. For each Survey in the
input list, it executes all functions specified in `...` and combines
the results.

Supported estimation types:

- "monthly": Monthly estimations

- "quarterly": Quarterly estimations

- "annual": Annual estimations

Each estimation call accepts an optional `domain` argument to restrict
the estimation to a subpopulation (domain) while respecting the sampling
design. The expression is captured unevaluated and applied with
[`subset.survey.design`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/survey/man/subset.survey.design.html)
on the design — never by filtering the data — so standard errors and
degrees of freedom are the correct ones for domain estimation:

    workflow(
      list(svy),
      survey::svymean(~pea, domain = e27 >= 14),
      estimation_type = "annual"
    )

`domain` works with any estimation function, including `svyby` (domain +
groups). When a domain is used, the `stat` column includes the domain
expression to disambiguate estimations of the same variable over
different domains.

For PoolSurvey objects, it uses a specialized methodology that handles
pooling of multiple surveys. When a compound `estimation_type` is used
(e.g. `"annual:monthly"`), point estimates are averaged across the `k`
pooled surveys and the standard error is computed as
`sqrt(mean(variance) * (1 + rho * (k - 1)) / k)`, where `rho` (default
`0`, passed as a named argument through `...`) is the correlation
between waves of a rotating panel. The former `R` argument is deprecated
and ignored.

For RotativePanelSurvey objects with monthly follow-up surveys (e.g. ECH
2021+), `estimation_type = "annual:mean_of_months"` computes the annual
estimate as the simple average of the monthly estimates: each follow-up
is estimated with its monthly weight (replicate weights are used when
the monthly design has them), the point estimates are averaged within
each year, and the standard errors are combined assuming independence
between months (`se = sqrt(mean(variance) / k)` for `k` months, or with
the `rho` correction described above when `rho` is supplied). One row
per year and statistic is returned, with the year in the `type` column.
The alias `"annual:mean_of_months"` is also accepted for PoolSurvey
objects, where it is equivalent to `"annual:monthly"`.

## Examples

``` r
# Simple estimation
dt <- data.table::data.table(
  x = rnorm(100), g = sample(c("a", "b"), 100, TRUE),
  w = rep(1, 100)
)
svy <- Survey$new(

  psu = NULL, engine = "data.table",
  weight = add_weight(annual = "w")

  estimation_type = "annual"

# Domain estimation with svyby
result_by <- workflow(
  svy = list(svy),
  survey::svyby(~x, ~g, survey::svymean, na.rm = TRUE),
  estimation_type = "annual"
)
#> Warning: CV may not be useful for negative statistics

# Domain (subpopulation) estimation: subset applied on the design
result_domain <- workflow(
  svy = list(svy),
  survey::svymean(~x, na.rm = TRUE, domain = g == "a"),

result_90 <- workflow(
  svy = list(svy),
  survey::svymean(~x, na.rm = TRUE),
  estimation_type = "annual",

# Per-call confidence level (overrides workflow default)
result_mixed <- workflow(
  svy = list(svy),
  survey::svymean(~x, na.rm = TRUE, level = 0.80),
  estimation_type = "annual"
