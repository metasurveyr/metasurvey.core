# Get implantation survey from a rotating panel

Extracts the implantation (baseline) survey from a RotativePanelSurvey
object. The implantation survey represents the first data collection
wave and is essential for establishing the baseline and structural
characteristics of the panel.

## Usage

``` r
get_implantation(RotativePanelSurvey)
```

## Arguments

- RotativePanelSurvey:

  A `RotativePanelSurvey` object from which to extract the implantation
  survey

## Value

A `Survey` object containing the implantation survey with all its
metadata, data, and design configuration

## Details

The implantation survey is special in a rotating panel because:

- Establishes the baseline: Defines initial characteristics of all panel
  units

- Contains the full sample: Includes all units that will participate in
  the different panel waves

- Defines temporal structure: Establishes rotation and follow-up
  patterns

- Configures metadata: Contains information about periodicity, key
  variables, and stratification

- Serves as tracking reference: Basis for unit tracking in subsequent
  waves

This function is essential for analysis requiring:

- Temporal comparisons from the baseline

- Analysis of the complete panel structure

- Configuration of longitudinal models

- Evaluation of sampling design quality
