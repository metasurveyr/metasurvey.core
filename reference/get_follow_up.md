# Get follow-up surveys from a rotating panel

Extracts one or more follow-up surveys (waves after the implantation)
from a RotativePanelSurvey object. Follow-up surveys represent
subsequent data collections and are essential for longitudinal and
temporal change analysis.

## Usage

``` r
get_follow_up(
  RotativePanelSurvey,
  index = seq_along(RotativePanelSurvey$follow_up)
)
```

## Arguments

- RotativePanelSurvey:

  A `RotativePanelSurvey` object from which to extract the follow-up
  surveys

- index:

  Integer vector specifying which follow-up surveys to extract. Defaults
  to all available (1:length(follow_up)). Can be a single index or a
  vector of indices

## Value

A list of `Survey` objects corresponding to the specified follow-up
surveys. If a single index is specified, returns a list with one element

## Details

Follow-up surveys are fundamental in rotating panels because:

- Enable longitudinal analysis: Track the same units over time

- Capture temporal changes: Evolution of economic, social, and
  demographic variables

- Maintain representativeness: Each wave preserves population
  representativeness through controlled rotation

- Optimize resources: Reuse information from previous waves to reduce
  collection costs

- Facilitate comparisons: Consistent temporal structure for trend
  analysis

In rotating panels like ECH:

- Each follow-up wave covers a specific period (monthly/quarterly)

- Units rotate gradually maintaining temporal overlap

- Indices correspond to the chronological collection order

- Each follow-up maintains methodological consistency with implantation
